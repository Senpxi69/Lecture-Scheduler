Once an instructor is assigned to a lecture on a date, they cannot be assigned to another lecture on the same date.
Similarly, no other course can be assigned to the same instructor on the same date.
4. Date Assignment on Course Addition
Dates are automatically assigned to the selected instructor upon adding a new course.
